class EdgeSplitter(object):
    """
    Class for generating training and test data for link prediction in graphs.

    The class requires as input a graph (in networkx format) and a percentage as a function of the total number of edges
    in the given graph of the number of positive and negative edges to sample. For heterogeneous graphs, the caller
    can also specify the type of edge and an edge property to split on. In the latter case, only a date property
    can be used and it must be in the format ``dd/mm/yyyy``. A date to be used as a threshold value such that only
    edges that have date after the threshold must be given. This effects only the sampling of positive edges.

    Negative edges are sampled at random by (for 'global' method) selecting two nodes in the graph and
    then checking if these edges are connected or not. If not, the pair of nodes is considered a negative sample.
    Otherwise, it is discarded and the process repeats. Alternatively, negative edges are sampled (for 'local' method)
    using DFS search at a distance from the source node (selected at random from all nodes in the graph)
    sampled according to a given set of probabilities.

    Positive edges can be sampled so that when they are subsequently removed from the graph, the reduced graph is either
    guaranteed, or not guaranteed, to remain connected. In the former case, graph connectivity is maintained by first
    calculating the minimum spanning tree. The edges that belong to the minimum spanning tree are protected from
    removal, and therefore cannot be sampled for the training set. The edges that do not belong to the minimum spanning
    tree are then sampled uniformly at random, until the required number of positive edges have been sampled for the
    training set. In the latter case, when connectedness of the reduced graph is not guaranteed, positive edges are
    sampled uniformly at random from all the edges in the graph, regardless of whether they belong to the spanning tree
    (which is not calculated in this case).

    Args:
        g (StellarGraph or networkx object): The graph to sample edges from.
        g_master (StellarGraph or networkx object): The graph representing the original dataset and a superset of the
            graph g. If it is not None, then when positive and negative edges are sampled, care is taken to make sure
            that a true positive edge is not sampled as a negative edge.

        neighbourhood of randomly (uniformly) sampled source nodes at distances defined by the probabilities in probs.

            probs (list): Probability distribution for the distance between source and target nodes.
            limit_samples (int, optional): It limits the maximum number of samples to the given number, if not None
