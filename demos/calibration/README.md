## Ensemble learning for graph neural network algorithms

This folder contains two [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) python notebooks demonstrating `StellarGraph` model calibration
for binary (`calibration-pubmed-link-prediction.ipynb`) and multi-class
classification (`calibration-pubmed-node-classification.ipynb`) problems.
