A knowledge graph (aka RDF, triple stores or knowledge base) is an extreme form of an heterogeneous graph, with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of edge (or relation) types.

    "As we saw above when adding node features, `StellarGraph` uses the index of the DataFrame as the connection between a node and a row of the DataFrame. Currently our dataframe just has a simple numeric range as the index, but it needs to be using the `id` column. Pandas offers [a few ways to control the indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#set-reset-index); in this case, we want to replace the current index by moving the `id` column to it, which is done most easily with `set_index`:"
