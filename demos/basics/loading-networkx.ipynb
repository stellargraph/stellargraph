    "> This demo is explains how to load data from NetworkX into a form that can be used by the StellarGraph library. [See all other demos](../README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io) is a library for working with graphs that provides many convenient I/O functions, graph algorithms and other tools for working with graphs. The StellarGraph library supports loading graph information from NetworkX graphs. If your data is naturally a NetworkX graph, this is a great way to load it. If your data does not *need* to be a NetworkX graph, [loading via Pandas](loading-pandas.ipynb) is likely to be faster and potentially more convenient.\n",

This notebook demonstrates loading data from Pandas. Loading from Pandas is more efficient and more convenient for pre-processing (some of which is demonstrated), and is thus encouraged.
