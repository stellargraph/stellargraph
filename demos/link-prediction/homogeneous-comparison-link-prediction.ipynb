    "This demo notebook compares the link prediction performance of the embeddings learned by Node2Vec [1], Attri2Vec [2], GraphSAGE [3] and GCN [4] on the Cora dataset, under the same edge train-test-split setting. Node2Vec and Attri2Vec are learned by capturing the random walk context node similarity. GraphSAGE and GCN are learned in an unsupervised way by making nodes co-occurring in short random walks represented closely in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to tackle link prediction as a supervised learning problem on top of node representations/embeddings. After obtaining embeddings, a binary classifier can be used to predict a link, or not, between any two nodes in the graph. Various hyperparameters could be relevant in obtaining the best link classifier - this demo demonstrates incorporating model selection into the pipeline for choosing the best binary operator to apply on a pair of node embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain embeddings for each node\n",
    "2. For each set of hyperparameters, train a classifier\n",
    "3. Select the classifier that performs the best\n",
    "4. Evaluate the selected classifier on unseen data to validate its ability to generalise\n",
