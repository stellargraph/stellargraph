    "This is the python implementation of the attri2vec algorithm outlined in paper ***[Attributed Network Embedding Via Subspace Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04095)*** D. Zhang, Y. Jie, X. Zhu and C. Zhang, arXiv:1901.04095, [cs.SI], 2019. The implementation uses the stellargraph libraries.\n",

    "## attri2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "attri2vec learns node representations by performing a linear/non-linear mapping on node content attributes. To make the learned node representations respect structural similarity, [`DeepWalk`](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623732)/[`node2vec`](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec) learning mechanism is used to make nodes sharing similar random walk context nodes represented closely in the subspace, which is achieved by maximizing the occurrence probability of context nodes conditioned on the representation of the target nodes. The probability is modelled by Softmax and negative sampling is used to speed up its calculation. This makes attri2vec equivalent to predict whether a node occurs in the given target node's context in random walks with the representation of the target node, by minimizing the cross-entropy loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "In implementation, node embeddings are learnt by solving a simple classification task: given a large set of \"positive\" `(target, context)` node pairs generated from random walks performed on the graph (i.e., node pairs that co-occur within a certain context window in random walks), and an equally large set of \"negative\" node pairs that are randomly selected from the graph according to a certain distribution, learn a binary classifier that predicts whether arbitrary node pairs are likely to co-occur in a random walk performed on the graph. Through learning this simple binary node-pair-classification task, the model automatically learns an inductive mapping from attributes of nodes to node embeddings in a low-dimensional vector space, which preserves structural and feature similarities of the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the attri2vec model, we first construct a training set of nodes, which is composed of an equal number of positive and negative `(target, context)` pairs from the graph. The positive `(target, context)` pairs are the node pairs co-occurring on random walks over the graph whereas the negative node pairs are the sampled randomly from the global node degree distribution of the graph. In attri2vec, each node is attached with two kinds of embeddings: 1) the inductive 'input embedding', i.e, the objective embedding, obtained by perform a non-linear transformation on node content features, and 2) 'output embedding', i.e., the parameter vector used to predict its occurrence as a context node, obtained by looking up a parameter table. Given a `(target, context)` pair, attri2vec outputs a predictive value to indicate whether it is positive or negative, which is obtained by performing the dot product of the 'input embedding' of the target node and the 'output embedding' of the context node, followed by a sigmoid activation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The entire model is trained end-to-end by minimizing the binary cross-entropy loss function with regards to predicted node pair labels and true node pair labels, using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates of the model parameters, with minibatches of 'training' node pairs generated on demand and fed into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we first train the attri2vec model on the in-sample subgraph and obtain a mapping function from node attributes to node representations, then apply the mapping function to the content attributes of out-of-sample nodes and obtain the representations of out-of-sample nodes. We evaluate the quality of inferred out-of-sample node representations by using it to predict the links of out-of-sample nodes."

The DBLP network contains 18,448 papers and 45,661 citation relations.
