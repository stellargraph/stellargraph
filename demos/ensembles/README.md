## Ensemble learning for graph neural network algorithms

This folder contains two [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) python notebooks demonstrating the use of ensemble learning
for node attribute inference (`ensemble-node-classification-example.ipynb`) and
link prediction (`ensemble-link-prediction-example.ipynb`) using `StellarGraph`'s graph neural network algorithms.
