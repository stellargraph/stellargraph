StellarGraph demos
==================

`StellarGraph <https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph>`_ provides numerous algorithms for graph machine learning. This folder contains demos of all of them to explain how they work and how to use them as part of a TensorFlow Keras data science workflow.

The demo notebooks can be run without any installation of Python by using Binder or Google Colab - these both provide a cloud-based notebook environment.  The whole set of demos can be opened in Binder |binder| or you can click the Binder and Colab badges within each notebook.

* Introduction to StellarGraph and its graph machine learning workflow (with TensorFlow and Keras): :doc:`GCN on Cora <node-classification/gcn-node-classification>`
* Predicting attributes, such as classifying as a class or label, or regressing to calculate a continuous number:

  * For nodes/vertices/entities: :doc:`node classification <./node-classification/index>`
  * For edges/links/connections: :doc:`link prediction <./link-prediction/index>` (includes knowledge graph completion)
  * For graphs/networks: :doc:`graph classification <./graph-classification/index>`
  * Adjusting predictions scores to be probabilities (for any model): :doc:`calibration <./calibration/index>`
  * Interpreting/introspecting models, for node classification: :doc:`interpretability <./interpretability/index>`

* Representation learning or computing embedding vectors (including unsupervised tasks):

  * For nodes/vertices/entities and edges/links/connections: :doc:`embeddings <./embeddings/index>`

* Time series or sequence prediction for nodes within a graph (including spatio-temporal data): :doc:`time series <./time-series/index>`
* Ensembling models to reduce prediction variance: :doc:`ensembles <./ensembles/index>`
* Loading data into a ``StellarGraph`` object, with Pandas, Neo4j or NetworkX: :doc:`basics <./basics/index>`
* Experimental: running GraphSAGE or Cluster-GCN on data stored in Neo4j: :doc:`neo4j connector <./connector/neo4j/index>`
