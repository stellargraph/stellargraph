Graph classification using StellarGraph
=======================================

`StellarGraph <https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph>`_ provides an algorithm for graph classification. This folder contains a demo to explain how it works and how to use it as part of a TensorFlow Keras data science workflow.

A graph classification task predicts an attribute of each graph in a collection of graphs. For instance, labelling each graph with a categorical class (binary classification or multiclass classification), or predicting a continuous number (regression). It is supervised or semi-supervised, where the model is trained using a subset of graphs that have ground-truth labels.
