Ensemble learning
=====================================================

This folder contains two `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ python notebooks demonstrating the use of ensemble learning
for node attribute inference (``ensemble-node-classification-example.ipynb``) and
link prediction (``ensemble-link-prediction-example.ipynb``) using ``StellarGraph``'s graph neural network algorithms.
